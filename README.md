# EV-Project
The goal of our database was to serve as a comprehensive repository for detailed information
about various electric vehicles. Key attributes of interest include the Year, Make, Model, Vehicle
Type, and Clean Alternative Fuel Vehicle (CAFV) Eligibility. We chose to focus on electric
vehicles as they are becoming prevalent nationwide.
